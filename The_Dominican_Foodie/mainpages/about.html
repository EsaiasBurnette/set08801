        <h2>Our Story</h2>
		
		<p> Hailing from the  nature island of Dominica, the Dominicanfoodie.com creators seeked to create a website that showcased the exquisite food of the island
        and shared its rich cultural heritage with the world. They wanted to provide a platform where visitors could explore the traditional and modern dishes of Dominica and learn about the stories and history behind them.
        
        One of the unique features of The Dominican Foodie was its section on recipes for cultural holidays in Dominica and the natural remedies that are associated with the islands bush medicines. </p>
