        <img src="..\img\lemongrass.png" alt="Drink">

        <p>Lemongrass is a fragrant herb commonly used in cooking, but it also has many health benefits and has been used as a natural remedy for centuries.
			 One of the most well-known benefits of lemongrass is its ability to help relieve anxiety and stress. Lemongrass contains compounds that have a 
			 calming effect on the nervous system, which can help reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. It is also known to have anti-inflammatory properties,
			  which makes it effective at reducing pain and inflammation throughout the body. Additionally, lemongrass is a natural diuretic, which means it can help
			   flush out toxins from the body and improve kidney function. It is also believed to have antimicrobial properties, making it an effective natural 
			   remedy for fighting off infections. Lemongrass can be brewed as tea or used in essential oil form for aromatherapy purposes.
			 It's important to note that while lemongrass is generally safe, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before using any natural remedies.</p>
