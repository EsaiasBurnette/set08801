        <h1>DOMINICAN STREET FOOD</h1>

		<p>Street food in the Commonwealth of Dominica is a vibrant and eclectic cuisine that reflects the island's rich natural resources and cultural diversity.
			Dominica's street food scene is largely based on local produce and seafood, which are transformed into delicious and affordable snacks and dishes. 
			Some of the most popular street foods in Dominica include the fried and crispy bakes, which are made from a dough of flour, salt, and water and 
			filled with saltfish or meat, as well as the spicy and tangy chicken or fish patties, which are made from a mixture of ground meat or fish and spices, 
			and then deep-fried until golden brown. Other street foods in Dominica include the plantain chips, grilled corn on the cob, and freshly squeezed juices
			 made from locally grown fruits such as mangoes, passionfruit, and soursop. 
		   The street food scene in Dominica is a must-try for food lovers looking to taste the flavors of the island and experience its vibrant and colorful culture.</p>
