        <h1>DOMINICAN TRADITIONAL FOOD</h1>
		The traditional food in the Commonwealth of Dominica is a rich and flavorful cuisine that reflects the island's history, culture, 
		and natural resources. The cuisine is largely based on fresh, locally sourced ingredients, including seafood, vegetables, and fruits.
		 One of the most popular traditional dishes in Dominica is the national dish of the island, called "mountain chicken" which is actually 
		 made from frog legs. Other popular dishes include "callaloo" which is a soup made from leafy greens, seafood and coconut milk, "rice and peas" 
		 which is a dish of rice, beans and spices, and "stewed chicken" which is chicken cooked in a tomato-based sauce with herbs and spices. 
		 The traditional food in Dominica also includes a variety of side dishes, such as "provisions" which are starchy vegetables like yams, cassava, and plantains, 
		 as well as a variety of hot sauces made from local peppers.
		 Dominica's traditional food is a delicious and unique cuisine that is a must-try for anyone visiting the island.</p>
